numerical=["A new media object can be described formally." , "A new media object is subject to algorithmic manipulation." , "All new media objects are composed of digital code; they are numerical representations." , "In short, media becomes programmable." , "New media is digitized." ]


modularity=["the fractal structure of new media" , "Media elements are represented as collections of discrete samples that are assembled into larger-scale objects but continue to maintain their separate identities." , "In short, a new media object consists of independent parts, each of which consists of smaller independent parts, and so on, down to the level of the smallest 'atoms'." , "an analogy between the modularity of new media and structured computer programming which involves writing small and self-sufficient modules which are then assembled into larger programs." , "the concept of 'object' used in Microsoft Office applications."]


automation=["The numerical coding of media and the modular structure of a media object allow for the automation of many operations involved in media creation, manipulation, and access." , "human intentionality can be removed from the creative process" , "the computer user modifies or creates from scratch a media object using templates or simple algorithms" , "automation of media access became the next logical stage of the process that had been put into motion when the first photograph was taken."]
